# Breaking-API
## *NOTE: This project will no longer work due to the "https://www.breakingbadapi.com/documentation" website has stopped working, and thus the API it's no longer available*

“The Breaking Bad API is a collection of information on the Vince Gilligan series Breaking Bad, as well as his incredible spin-off Better Call Saul. This site is designed to make it easy on the developer to see what HTTP requests are possible, and what information is available.”

“The following information is provided through this API...”

Characters, Episodes, Quotes, Deaths

Here's a snippet on how the website looked like:
